**Gameplay**

At the start of the game, each player must have 3 cards in hand. Then, one card must be reveales and partially placed behind the drawing deck. That card will mark the ruling suit. 

The other players, when it is their turn, can play any card, with no need to match the suit or play a trump card. The trick is won by the highest trump card played or, if no trump is played, by the highest card of the suit that led. The trump is a card that matches the ruling suit.

After the round, in winning order the players must draw a card and have 3 again in hand to be prepared for the next round. When there's no cards left to draw the game continues until the cards in hand are all played. Then the game ends and it's computed the overall score.

The 7 and 2 of the ruling suit can be used to be exchanged for the ruling card. 7 if it is grater then 7, 2 otherwise. This must be done after a hand is played and before drawing the next card. It cannot be done when there are two cards remaining.
